# jiku desktop app

Just a simple wrapper around [jiku.ca/again](http://jiku.ca/again) for now.
Should work with MacOS ([64-bit](https://github.com/jiku/desktop-app/releases/download/v0.0.1/jiku-v0.0.1.dmg)) and Windows ([32-](https://github.com/jiku/desktop-app/releases/download/v0.0.1/jiku-32-v0.0.1.exe) and [64-bit](https://github.com/jiku/desktop-app/releases/download/v0.0.1/jiku-v0.0.1.exe)).

## PLANS

On top of [this](http://github.com/jiku/again/issues) and [this](http://github.com/jiku/again-src/issues), add desktop-centric features, like

- [ ] Mirror [jiku.ca](http://jiku.ca) with [jiku.ca/again](http://jiku.ca/again) being a subsection
- [ ] Auto-update (while still providing versioned installers on GitHub?)
- [ ] Layout
  - [ ] Minimize to tray
  - [ ] Switch between app and mini-player
- [ ] Notifications (multi-level, for new content)
- [ ] Offline support
- [ ] Sign for both MacOS and Windows
- [ ] Add to MacOS App Store
